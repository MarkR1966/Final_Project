# Final Project

## Spring Pet Clinic

#### Authors: Mark Rafferty, Michael McGarrigle, David McCartney, Garry Farrow, Robert Siberry, Peter Smith


## Scope
We will be working with these externally developed applications:

https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angular

https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-rest

They are well documented applications for the ‘Spring Pet Clinic’ domain, one of which serves as a front end client using AngularJS and the other as an API using Java.

## Requirements
We will plan, design and implement a solution for automating the development workflows and deployments of this application. As part of our final deliverable we will need to discuss the project in a presentation and demonstrate these workflows.

Using what we have learned consider the following:

What tools will work for you best? For example: Terraform, Kubernetes, Ansible etc. There is no restrictions or requirements on which ones to use; you should decide which you feel are most appropriate and justify their use.

Multiple Environment support: How can a developer test their new features on an environment before merging their changes to the main branch?

How can changes on the GitHub repository automatically build and deploy to testing and live environments?

Running costs. What are your monthly estimates? How could they be improved?
